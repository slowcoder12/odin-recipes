    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken biryani is a delectable Indian dish that combines the aromatic and flavorful basmati rice with tender pieces of chicken and a medley of spices and herbs. Biryani is a dish that is popular throughout the Indian subcontinent and has become a favorite among people all around the world. The dish is traditionally served at festive occasions and celebrations, but it is also enjoyed as a regular meal in many households.</p>

    <p>The preparation of chicken biryani involves a few steps, but the end result is a dish that is worth the effort. First, the rice is washed and soaked for about 30 minutes to remove any impurities and to allow it to absorb water. Meanwhile, chicken pieces are marinated with a mixture of yogurt and spices for a few hours to enhance the flavor and tenderize the meat. Then, onions, ginger, and garlic are sautéed in oil or ghee until fragrant, and the marinated chicken is added and cooked until it is cooked through. Finally, the partially cooked rice is layered on top of the chicken in a large pot, along with additional spices and herbs, and the dish is cooked on low heat</p>
